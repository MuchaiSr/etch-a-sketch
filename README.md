# Etch-a-sketch
This is a project that follows The Odin Project. Learners are tasked with creating building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 
The project was meant to test the learners understanding of DOM manipulation as well as revise some CSS concepts such as flexbox.
